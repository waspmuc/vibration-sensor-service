# Vibration Sensor Service
This sensor is located under the Tischkicker Arnim-Kreutzer-Arena and directly mounted on it. It measures the vibration intensity of the Tischkicker. Find detailed specification of the sensor here [Grove-Vibration-Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Piezo_Vibration_Sensor). Currently it delivers the measured vibration at the moment of the call. A more comprehensive response is coming soon. ;)
